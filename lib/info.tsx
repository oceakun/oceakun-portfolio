      Over the past year, I've heavily worked on the frontend with <b>React.js</b>, <b>Next.js</b> and <b>Astro</b>, with <b>Go</b> and <b>Docker</b> on the backend. <br /> <br /> 
      
      I volunteer at <b>Alias</b>, a club actively maintaining an <b>Open Source Community </b>and trying to educate students about the same at our university. <br/><br /> 
      
      I love gardening, attending developer meetups and watching films in my free time.
